Here we will talk about the basics parts that make up a Mechnical Keyboard. Understanding the function of each is not only important to building your board, but also tuning the sound and feel of your board as well.

## The Case

The Case is the most identifiable part of the keyboard because it is always in sight. The case houses all the smaller parts that will make up your board: The plate, PCB, switches, and keycaps. The cases job is to house all the components and provide a mounting style that will produce the sound and feel desired by the user. We will get more into mounting styles in a later post, but different mounting styles will result in different sounds and typing feels. This is one of the biggest factor when choosing a kit. 

Another big factor is the physical case design and what materials it is made of. Material selection and case design are the the biggest factors when it comes to selecting a sound you enjoy. Different materials will create different sounds based on the properties, so it is important to take this into account as well.  

> Common materials for cases include Aluminium and Polycarbonate. Other exotic materials such as brass and copper will also be used, but are typically rarer and more expensive due to the manufacturing needed to produce those boards. 

## The Plate and PCB

The next components are the Plate and PCB. The PCB acts like a motherboard for your keyboard. It contains all the circuits and parts that make your keyboard work with your computer. PCBs can come in a vast amount of colors and layouts, but they all accomplish the same job. The simply are designed to take the input from your switches and transmit them to your computer to register the keypress. 

>Some are concerned about the latency of custom keyboards or how fast they transmit the keypress. With the current USB-C being widely used in the custom Mechnical keyboard hobby, this concern is futile for those who are concerned.

The plate holds the switches in place for the PCB. The plate helps stablize the switches and is also a main component when it comes to affecting sound. Depending on the material of your choice, you can affect the sound of your keyboard in various different ways, giving you control on how you want your keyboard to sound. 

> Typical materials include Polycarbonate, Aluminium, and Brass. Other materials exist, but we talk about plates in the post here (Insert post here)
